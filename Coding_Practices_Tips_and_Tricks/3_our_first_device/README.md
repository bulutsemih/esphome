# ESPHome, Coding practices, tips and tricks, Tutorial 3, Our First device

This series of tutorials is specifically designed for intermediate ESPHome users who have already completed my tutorial on "Creating a Room Sensor from Scratch" and are looking to take their skills to the next level.

In this tutorial, we will continue moduralizing our project by creating our first device.

## Code

You will find all the code files in the [ESPHOME](/Coding_Practices_Tips_and_Tricks/3_our_first_device/ESPHOME/) directory. I have only included the directory that have changed or are neccesary, so you can carry the directory structure from the last tutorial.
